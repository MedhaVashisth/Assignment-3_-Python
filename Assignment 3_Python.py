1. A function is a block of reusable code that is used to perform a specific action. The advantages of using functions are:

- Reducing duplication of code
- Decomposing complex problems into simpler pieces
- Improving clarity of the code
- Reuse of code
- Information hiding

2. When it is called
3. Def creates a function
4. A function call is an expression containing the function name followed by the function call operator, () . If the function has been defined to receive parameters, the values that are to be sent into the function are listed inside the parentheses of the function call operator.
5. There's only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten. Otherwise, the next time you were to run the program, the names would remember their values from the previous run.
6. When the execution of the function terminates (returns), the local variables are destroyed. Codelens helps you visualize this because the local variables disappear after the function returns.
7. A return is a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task. A return value can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string. The type of value your function returns depends largely on the task it performs.Since return_42() returns a numeric value, you can use that value in a math expression or any other kind of expression in which the value has a logical or coherent meaning. This is how a caller code can take advantage of a function's return value.
8. If no return statement appears in a function definition, control automatically returns to the calling function after the last statement of the called function is executed. In this case, the return value of the called function is undefined
9. Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function. To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.
10. The None keyword is used to define a null value, or no value at all. None is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string. None is a data type of its own (NoneType) and only None can be None.
11. That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic.
12. spam. bacon().
13. When it encounters an error, the control is passed to the except block, skipping the code in between. As seen in the above code, we have moved our code inside a try and except statement. Try running the program and it should throw an error message instead of crashing the program.
14. The try block lets you test a block of code for errors. The except block lets you handle the error. The else block lets you execute code when there is no error. The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.
